				<h2>An introduction...</h2>
				<h3>23rd of January 2016</h3>

				<p>Hello readers! Welcome to my online journal slash blog slash image bank slash brain vomit. In case you are unaware, I am travelling to New York, USA to live and work for at least the next three months. I fgured that while I am away, I should be really documenting what I get up to, so that when I am old and feel the need to relive my younger days, I will have a place to source my stories for my uninterested grandchildren.</p>
				<br>
				<p>To elaborate on why I am going to New York, I have been awarded a scholarship from AUT, my university. The scholarship programme, <a href="https://internz.aut.ac.nz/">AUT Internz</a>, links graduating students with companies based in the USA. After a Skype interview with <a href="http://redantler.com">Red Antler</a>, the company saw me as a good fit for their workplace and I was then awarded the scholarship from AUT Internz to head over to the States. Red Antler is a place that build brands for startups that are changing how the world works. They work through many avenues of advertising and digital experiences, and that's where I come in. I will be working as a front-end developer, which basically means I will be in the team of people who code up what a website looks and feels like, making sure it runs smoothly and responsively through devices.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I have successfully acquired accommodation for my first week in Brooklyn. My airline hopping has me travelling from Auckland to Los Angeles to then finally land in New York sometime in the evening. I figured to make it easiest on myself, it was in my best interest to stay at a cheap hotel on my first night. I have sourced an Airbnb in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn for the week following, staying with in a young couple's apartment. I am excited to meet some locals and all that, but my main concern for that first week is to find a more permanent apartment to live in.</p>
				<br>
				<p>By the time this blog post has been posted, I would have hopefully lined up some apartment viewings for my first week in the concrete jungle. All going well, the plan is to have a place to move into by the 1st of Feburary, which is conveniently my first day at work.</p>

				<p>It is a strange feeling, packing my life into a 23kg bag... Or should I be saying 50lbs? A weird exercise of deciding what I need versus how heavy it is - Fortunately, my tripod just made the cut. I am unsure of whether this trip feels real yet, but I suppose if it doesn't now, it will feel real very soon. As I'm writing this post, I am 30 mins from leaving to go to the airport. Talk about last minute...</p>

				<p>Emily (seen above) is my partner in non-criminal activities, such as watching movies and buying coffee. We have a special relationship I feel, where she gets me and I get her. Unfortunately, this gem is not coming with me over to New York, which obviously is hard for the both of us. I will miss her terribly, but a year in the scheme of life will go like nothing (hopefully)!</p>
				<br>
				<p>Anyway, I should probably get into some fresh clothes and hop on a plane! Exciting times ahead. There is a blizzard watch in NYC for the next day or so, so good luck to me eh. Should be fine, but still keeping my fingers crossed! Goodbye to all the New Zealand people. I will try keep this blog going semi-regularly, with some posts smaller and some larger. Also, Check out the <a href="../photoreel">photo reel page</a> for just the photos from the posts!</p>
